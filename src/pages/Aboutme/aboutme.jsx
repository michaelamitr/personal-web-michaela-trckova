          My name is Michaela and I am a junior front-end developer. I have been
          working on my education in the IT field for a while already and now, I
          am ready and open to find a job as a junior frontend developer. I
          would like to use my achieved skills and further develop myself, my
          abilities and be part of a supportive and friendly team.

          I started my journey with Czechitas. It was my greatest pleasure to be
          accepted to a Digital Academy â€“ Web. A 300 hrs course, which opened a
          door into IT for me. I am very grateful for this opportunity. It was a
          lot of hard work, but it was definitely worth it and I gained a lot of
          valuable knowledge and practice.
        </p>
        <p className="about-me__text">
          I decided on the front-end because I consider myself as a creative
          person with a good eye for detail and aesthetic. Design is one of my
          passions. Frontend is a great fit for me and I really enjoy developing
          myself as a front-end developer.
