    "reference": "Míša stands out among her peers from the Digital Academy in the way she thinks about projects as a whole, while she can well estimate the component structure even before she reaches the code. And when she says that she needs help with something, it usually means that she just needs to say out loud what the problem is and then she solves it by herself."

    "reference": "Míša confidently tries new things to give projects an extra twist and stand out from the rest. She can deal with arbitrarily complex problems on her own, or just a little guidance in the right direction is all she needs. She cared about the project, collaborated well, and when she wasn't sure, she didn't shy away from asking questions, moving the development forward at a steady pace."
