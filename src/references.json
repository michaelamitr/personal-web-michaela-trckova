    "reference": "Míša stands out among her peers from the Digital Academy in the way she thinks about projects as a whole, while she can well estimate the component structure even before she reaches the code. And when she says that she needs help with something, it usually means that she just needs to say out loud what the problem is and then she solves it by herself."
